New York is 3 hours ahead of California,
but it does not make California slow.
Someone graduated at the age of 22,
but waited 5 years before securing a good job!
Someone became a CEO at 25,
and died at 50.
While another became a CEO at 50,
and lived to 90 years.
Someone is still single,
while someone else got married.
Obama retires at 55,
but Trump starts at 70.
Absolutely everyone in this world works based on their Time Zone.
People around you might seem to go ahead of you,
some might seem to be behind you.
But everyone is running their own RACE, in their own TIME.
Don't envy them or mock them.
They are in their TIME ZONE, and you are in yours!
So, Never Give up
You're not LATE.
You're not EARLY.
You are very much ON TIME, and in your TIME ZONE Destiny set up for you.
Keep fighting and stay alert, no matter how good;
Keep dreaming and carry on, no matter how hard;
Keep reading and exercising, no matter how busy;
Life is a long run.
